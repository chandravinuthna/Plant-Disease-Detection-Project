# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection Using Leaf Images  
### A Machine Learning-Based Approach (2023–2025 Research Integrated)

This project focuses on detecting plant diseases using leaf images based on datasets and research papers published between **2023–2025**.  
It uses publicly available datasets and follows the methodology referenced from the **main paper and 4 supporting papers** provided.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Plant diseases significantly reduce global agricultural productivity.  
Early detection helps farmers take corrective action and prevent crop loss.

This project analyzes plant leaf images and classifies them into:
- Healthy
- Diseased categories  
(using machine learning / deep learning models such as CNNs)
